# Handwriting-Classification
It's a feed foward neural network made in python that recgonizes hand written digits followed from the book called Neural Networks and Deep Learning
# How it works?
# Basics 
The neural network uses test images and training images. The neural network processes the training images and then it checks to see how close its prediction is to the actual number on the image.
Neural network weights updates for each of the 60 thousand training images.
